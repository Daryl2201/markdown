#MARKDOWN EXPLANATION by CARLOS#
**Markdown** - it is a text to HTML conversion tool for web writers. It’s ultimate goal is to allow us to read and write plan easier in text format and convert it into valid HTML.

It is become the default or the standard for formatting many certain types of text.

**Two things about Markdown**

- Plain text formatting syntax
- Software tool

**Different tools that allows us to format texts in various different ways:**

**Microsoft word** – it is very useful in providing various tools format and edit texts like if we just want to bold some text or make a simple list. 

**HTML** – it is most commonly used everywhere in the internet. It is more expressive and actually achieves some specific effect that may difficult or impossible in markdown. It has learning curve similar to MS Word but its benefits really depend on what we are using. It might overboard and unnecessary to learn if you just want to format texts like an email or certain documentation. 

##Markdown syntax##
It is comprised of punctuation and characters which have been chosen carefully to look like what they mean.  The asterisks represents as emphasis which pulls texts markdown lists look like lists. 

- **For Headings** we use **hash tags (#)** to represent what kind of heading we’re going to be using. To create a heading add a hash in front of a word or phrase - the number of hashes should correspond to the heading level If we want to create a heading level 3, we use 3 hashes.

- **For different types of emphasis we use other punctuation marks.** If you want to *italicize* text you simply add an **asterisk** before and after the word. In order to **bold** in it, you add **two asterisk** before and after the word, and if you want to have some strike through text you simply wrap the text until this.
- **For list honors** we  have quite simple syntax we can use to create and unordered list you’re given the option of using **dashes, asterisk or plus signs** to put them in line items and this will create a bulleted list.

- **For ordered lists** all we need to do is simply add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers don’t have to be in numerical order but the list should start with a number one and this will create a numbered list.

##How it works##
Markdown is basically plain text so it can be used anywhere but in this case, let us assume you wrote a file that has markdown syntax from there you’re gonna make sure that you save it with an extension called markdown or “.md”. 

It is capable of processing the markdown file. The application use something called a markdown processor also commonly referred to as a parser or an implementation that basically take down the markdown formatted text. Put it to HTML format at that point of document can be viewed in a web browser or combined with the stylesheet and print it. And it simply want to just experiment with markdown. 

**WHY SHOULD WE USE MARKDOWN?**

- **Accessibility** – markdown is very accessible to someone who doesn’t know the first thing about HTML.

- **It can be used everywhere** – example, it is widely used in software documentation particularly open source because it enables reach your formatting than plain text alone certain applications also support markdown so you can even format your text as markdown within the application itself. 

- **We can use it on websites** - markdown was assigned for the web so it should come as no surprise that there are plenty of applications specifically designed for creating website content.

For starters, you can use it on websites. Markdown was assigned for the web so there are plenty of applications specifically designed for creating website content. Although there are limitations on markdown if you’re intending to write something with straightforward text like blog, then markdown might save you some time. Markdown is a natural fit for a technical documentation. Companies like *Github* are increasingly switching to markdown for their documentation due to its ease of writing and reading the actual documents
 

**Important Note: : It is not a replacement to HTML. Its syntax is very small and it only corresponds to a very small subset of HTML tags, but the idea is not to create a syntax that makes it easier to insert HTML tags but to make it easy to read write and edit. Markdown formatting syntax only addresses issues that can be conveyed in plain text.**
